# Men-vs-Gorillas-NetLogo-Simulation
Overview
Men vs Gorillas is an interactive and visually distinctive simulation created in NetLogo, where humans and gorillas are placed in a strategic conflict scenario. Each agent (human or gorilla) has its own energy level, behavior, and custom movement, leading to a dynamic system of interaction and elimination.

This model was designed entirely from scratch, including the simulation logic, patch styling, and agent dynamics. It was built as both an academic and creative project to explore agent-based modeling in a fun, original context.

 Features
Custom-designed simulation mechanics
Including combat rules, energy decay, and automatic agent removal upon energy depletion.

Unique visual layout
A symbolic road separates the humans (top side) from the gorillas (bottom side), creating a clear battlefield.

Live statistics & plotting

Real-time tracking of survivors from each team

Plot chart showing population trends

Auto-stop condition when one side is fully eliminated

User-friendly interface

Monitors to count remaining humans and gorillas

Optional energy display toggled via interface

 Technical Details
Built using NetLogo, an agent-based modeling environment

Entire logic written in NetLogo's scripting language

Designed to be lightweight, readable, and extensible

Clean and documented structure (setup, go, move, fight, eliminate)

 Files Included
gorillas.nlogo â€“ the full NetLogo model file

README (this file)

 Getting Started
Open the project in NetLogo

Press Setup to initialize the model

Press Go to start the simulation

Observe the population graph and monitor values

The simulation automatically stops when one side wins

 Author's Note
This simulation was built with a unique visual and behavioral structure entirely designed by me. While inspired by classic agent-based modeling principles, its theme, layout, and mechanics reflect a personal take on conflict modeling with a humorous twist.
